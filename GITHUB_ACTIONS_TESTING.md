# GitHub Actions Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to test all the GitHub Actions workflows for the CIS Benchmark Checker project.

## üéØ Testing Overview

We'll test the following workflows:
1. **Security and Lint** - Automated code quality and security scanning
2. **CIS Compliance Check** - Compliance monitoring workflows
3. **Deploy and Test Infrastructure** - Infrastructure deployment automation

## üîß Prerequisites

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Fork or have admin access to the repository
- [ ] Ensure you're on the `github-actions-testing` branch
- [ ] Have GitHub Actions enabled in repository settings

### 2. AWS Account Setup (for infrastructure tests)
- [ ] AWS account with appropriate permissions
- [ ] AWS CLI configured locally for verification
- [ ] Decide between OIDC or Access Key authentication

### 3. Optional Integrations
- [ ] Slack workspace and webhook URL (for notifications)
- [ ] Email notifications configured

## üìã Test Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Workflow Validation ‚úÖ

#### Test 1.1: Security and Lint Workflow
**Objective:** Verify code quality and security scanning works

**Steps:**
1. **Trigger the workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Push to trigger automatically
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: trigger security and lint workflow"
   git push origin github-actions-testing
   
   # Method 2: Create a PR to main branch
   # This will trigger the workflow on pull_request event
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow:**
   - Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
   - Look for "Security Scan and Lint" workflow
   - Watch all 4 jobs run:
     - ‚úÖ Security Scanning
     - ‚úÖ Terraform Validation  
     - ‚úÖ Shell Script Validation
     - ‚úÖ Python Code Quality

3. **Expected Results:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Bandit finds Python security issues (if any)
   ‚úÖ Safety checks dependencies for vulnerabilities
   ‚úÖ Checkov scans Terraform for misconfigurations
   ‚úÖ TruffleHog scans for secrets
   ‚úÖ Terraform files validate successfully
   ‚úÖ Shell scripts pass ShellCheck
   ‚úÖ Python code quality checks run
   ‚úÖ Security reports uploaded as artifacts
   ```

4. **Verification:**
   - Download artifacts from the workflow run
   - Check `security-reports-{run_number}` contains:
     - `bandit-report.json`
     - `checkov-report.json`
   - Review any findings in the reports

**Expected Issues (these are normal):**
- Some Python linting warnings (Black formatting, flake8 style)
- Checkov may flag intentionally insecure test configurations
- Bandit may flag test code with hardcoded values

---

### Phase 2: GitHub Secrets Setup üîê

**Before testing compliance and infrastructure workflows, set up required secrets:**

#### Test 2.1: Configure AWS Authentication

**Option A: Access Keys (Simpler)**
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Add these secrets:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = AKIA...
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = your-secret-key
   ```

**Option B: OIDC (More Secure)**
1. Create an OIDC provider in AWS IAM
2. Create a role that GitHub can assume
3. Add secret:
   ```
   AWS_ROLE_ARN = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionsRole
   ```

#### Test 2.2: Optional Secrets
```
EKS_CLUSTER_NAME = your-existing-cluster-name (optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK = https://hooks.slack.com/services/... (optional)
```

---

### Phase 3: CIS Compliance Testing üõ°Ô∏è

#### Test 3.1: Manual Compliance Check
**Objective:** Test compliance checking against existing AWS resources

**Steps:**
1. **Trigger manually:**
   - Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **CIS Benchmark Compliance Check**
   - Click **Run workflow**
   - Select:
     - `Branch: github-actions-testing`
     - `Environment: dev`
     - `Controls: (leave empty for all)`
     - `Send Slack notification: true` (if configured)

2. **Monitor execution:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ AWS credentials configure successfully
   ‚úÖ Python dependencies install
   ‚úÖ CIS AWS compliance checks run
   ‚úÖ Kubernetes compliance checks run (if EKS available)
   ‚úÖ Results uploaded as artifacts
   ‚úÖ Summary posted to workflow
   ```

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Workflow completes (may have compliance failures - that's normal!)
   - Artifacts contain:
     - `aws-cis-results-{run_number}.json`
     - `k8s-cis-results-{run_number}.json` (if EKS available)
   - GitHub Step Summary shows compliance status
   - Slack notification sent (if configured)

#### Test 3.2: PR Comment Integration
**Steps:**
1. **Create a test PR:**
   ```bash
   # Make a small change to trigger workflow
   echo "# Test change" >> test-change.md
   git add test-change.md
   git commit -m "test: trigger PR compliance check"
   git push origin github-actions-testing
   ```

2. **Create PR:**
   - Go to GitHub and create PR from `github-actions-testing` to `main`
   - Watch for automatic workflow trigger

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Compliance check runs automatically
   - Results posted as PR comment
   - Security scan results also appear

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Deployment Testing üèóÔ∏è

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This creates real AWS resources that cost money!**

#### Test 4.1: Development Infrastructure Deployment
**Objective:** Test full infrastructure deployment and testing cycle

**Steps:**
1. **Deploy infrastructure:**
   - Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Deploy and Test CIS Infrastructure**
   - Click **Run workflow**
   - Select:
     - `Branch: github-actions-testing`
     - `Environment: dev`
     - `Action: deploy`
     - `Create non-compliant resources: true`

2. **Monitor deployment (~15-20 minutes):**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Terraform initializes successfully
   ‚úÖ Terraform plan shows resources to create
   ‚úÖ Infrastructure deploys (VPC, EKS, Security Groups, etc.)
   ‚úÖ Compliance tests run against new infrastructure
   ‚úÖ Test results uploaded
   ‚úÖ Infrastructure automatically destroyed (for dev environment)
   ```

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Complete infrastructure deployment
   - Compliance tests find intentional violations
   - Test artifacts contain detailed results
   - Infrastructure cleanly destroyed

#### Test 4.2: Test-Only Mode
**Steps:**
1. **Run tests against existing infrastructure:**
   - **Actions** ‚Üí **Deploy and Test CIS Infrastructure**
   - Select: `Action: test-only`
   - This runs compliance tests without deploying new infrastructure

---

### Phase 5: Automated Triggers Testing ü§ñ

#### Test 5.1: Scheduled Workflow (Optional)
**Note:** Scheduled workflows only run on the default branch (main)

**Steps:**
1. **Merge to main to test schedule:**
   ```bash
   # After all tests pass, merge the PR
   # Wait for scheduled run (daily at 6 AM UTC)
   ```

2. **Or modify schedule for testing:**
   ```yaml
   # In .github/workflows/cis-compliance-check.yml
   schedule:
     - cron: '*/15 * * * *'  # Every 15 minutes for testing
   ```

#### Test 5.2: Issue Creation on Failure
**Steps:**
1. **Force a failure:**
   - Temporarily break a compliance check
   - Let scheduled workflow run
   - Verify issue gets created automatically
