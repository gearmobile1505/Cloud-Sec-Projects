# Changelog - Azure Sentinel KQL Testing Environment

## Version 2.0 - August 3, 2025 üöÄ

### üéâ **Major Improvements**

#### **‚úÖ Automated VM Monitoring Setup**
- **Added**: Automatic installation of Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)
- **Added**: Automatic installation of Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)  
- **Added**: Data Collection Rule for Windows Security Events
- **Added**: Automatic DCR association with VM
- **Result**: VM security events work immediately after deployment - no manual configuration needed!

#### **‚úÖ Enhanced Data Collection**
- **Security Events**: Comprehensive Windows Security log collection
- **System Events**: Application and System event logs
- **Modern Support**: Compatible with both SecurityEvent and WindowsEvent tables
- **Query Compatibility**: Updated all sample queries to work with both legacy and modern data

#### **‚úÖ Improved Documentation**
- **Added**: Comprehensive deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`)
- **Updated**: Testing instructions with automated setup details
- **Added**: Troubleshooting section with agent status checks
- **Added**: Cost estimation and optimization tips

### üîß **Technical Changes**

#### **Terraform Configuration**
```diff
+ Added azurerm_virtual_machine_extension "ama" - Azure Monitor Agent
+ Added azurerm_monitor_data_collection_rule "security_events" 
+ Added azurerm_monitor_data_collection_rule_association "security_events"
+ Enhanced MMA configuration with proper workspace connection
```

#### **Data Collection Rules**
- **XPath Queries**: Security, System, and Application logs
- **Streams**: Microsoft-WindowsEvent for modern collection
- **Destinations**: Automatic Log Analytics workspace integration

#### **Updated Queries**
```kql
// Before: Only SecurityEvent table
SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4625

// After: Both legacy and modern tables
union SecurityEvent, WindowsEvent
| where (EventID == 4625 and isnotempty(SecurityEvent)) or (EventID == 4625 and isnotempty(WindowsEvent))
```

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**

#### **Resolved: VM Security Events Not Collecting**
- **Issue**: Manual agent configuration was required after VM deployment
- **Root Cause**: Missing Data Collection Rules and AMA agent
- **Fix**: Automated agent installation and DCR setup in Terraform

#### **Resolved: Query Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Queries only worked with legacy SecurityEvent table
- **Fix**: Updated all queries to use `union SecurityEvent, WindowsEvent`

#### **Resolved: Agent Status Uncertainty**
- **Issue**: No way to verify if agents were properly configured
- **Fix**: Added Heartbeat verification queries and troubleshooting steps

### üìä **Testing Validation**

#### **‚úÖ What Works Immediately**
1. **Key Vault Access Logging** - Verified working
2. **Network Security Group Logging** - Verified working  
3. **Log Analytics Data Ingestion** - Verified working
4. **Sentinel Alert Rules** - Deployed and enabled
5. **Terraform State Management** - All import errors resolved

#### **‚úÖ What Works After VM Deployment**
1. **Windows Security Events** - Now automated
2. **PowerShell Execution Monitoring** - Ready for testing
3. **Failed Login Detection** - Agent configured automatically
4. **Process Creation Events** - DCR configured for collection

### üéØ **Deployment Experience**

#### **Before**
```bash
terraform apply                    # ‚úÖ Infrastructure deployed
# Manual steps required:
# 1. Install monitoring agents via Portal
# 2. Configure data collection rules  
# 3. Associate DCR with VM
# 4. Wait 30+ minutes for events
# 5. Troubleshoot agent connectivity
```

#### **After**  
```bash
terraform apply                    # ‚úÖ Everything automated!
# Wait 10-15 minutes for agent installation
# Start testing immediately
```

### üí∞ **Cost Optimizations**

#### **VM Cost Controls**
- **Auto-shutdown**: 22:00 UTC daily (prevents overnight charges)
- **Smallest VM Size**: Standard_B1s (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM)
- **Standard Storage**: LRS for cost optimization
- **Optional Deployment**: VMs disabled by default

#### **Log Analytics Controls**  
- **Daily Quota**: 10GB limit prevents runaway costs
- **Retention**: 30 days (configurable)
- **Diagnostic Settings**: Only essential logs enabled

### üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

#### **Planned Improvements**
- [ ] Additional alert rules for advanced threat detection
- [ ] Integration with Azure Security Center recommendations
- [ ] Automated incident response playbooks
- [ ] Multi-region deployment support
- [ ] Container security monitoring

#### **Potential Features**
- [ ] Integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- [ ] Custom workbook templates for visualization
- [ ] Automated threat hunting queries
- [ ] SOAR integration capabilities
