## 📁 File Structure Details

Each phase builds on the previous one:

### Phase 1: Organizations Foundation
- Create AWS Organizations
- Set up basic account structure
- Configure organizational units (OUs)

### Phase 2: Control Tower Deployment
- Deploy Control Tower Landing Zone
- Configure core accounts (Log Archive, Audit)
- Set up baseline security controls

### Phase 3: Service Control Policies
- Implement governance guardrails
- Deploy preventive controls
- Configure compliance policies

### Phase 4: Account Factory for Terraform
- Set up AFT pipeline
- Configure account provisioning automation
- Implement account baselines

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Cost Implications:
- **Control Tower:** ~$3-5/month per managed account
- **Config Rules:** ~$2/rule/region/month
- **CloudTrail:** ~$2/100K events
- **GuardDuty:** ~$3-4/month per account

### Time to Deploy:
- **Organizations:** 5-10 minutes
- **Control Tower:** 60-90 minutes
- **SCPs:** 10-15 minutes
- **AFT:** 30-45 minutes
- **Total:** ~2-3 hours

### Prerequisites Check:
- ✅ No existing Control Tower setup
- ✅ No existing Organizations (or willing to import)
- ✅ Root user access or equivalent permissions
- ✅ Clean AWS account for management

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Choose your approach:**
   - Full automated deployment (all at once)
   - Phased approach (recommended)
   - Selective components only

2. **Review the implementation files** I'll create
3. **Customize** for your organization
4. **Deploy phase by phase** with proper testing

Would you like me to create the complete Terraform implementation with all these components?
